								I investigate the impact of mandatory reporting and auditing of firms’ financial statements on industry-wide resource allocation.
								Using size-based reporting and auditing requirements for limited liability firms in 26 European countries, I document reporting regulation,
								mandating a greater share of firms in an industry to disclose a full set of financial statements, fosters a competitive and dispersed type of
								resource allocation in product and capital markets, but does not unambiguously improve the efficiency of resource allocation. By contrast, I find
								auditing regulation, mandating a greater share of firms to obtain a financial-statement audit, imposes a net fixed cost of operating on firms,
								deterring entry of smaller firms. I do not find any other effects of auditing regulation on industry-wide resource allocation in my setting.
								My findings suggest reporting regulation substitutes a transactional type of resource allocation based on public information for a relational
								one based on private information. This substitution, however, fails to spur economic growth. With respect to firms’ auditing, my findings suggest
								it lacks significant industry-wide externalities compensating for firms’ costs of mandatory auditing.

								We examine the effects of financial reporting regulation on firms’ banking. Exploiting discontinuous public disclosure and auditing requirements assigned to
								otherwise similar small and medium-sized private firms, we document that financial reporting regulation reduces firms’ reliance on concentrated and local bank
								relationships and increases banks’ reliance on firms’ financial reporting, consistent with a shift in firms’ banking from relationship toward transactional
								approaches. Our evidence suggests that financial reporting regulation substitutes for banks’ information production role by burdening firms with the disclosure
								and auditing of their financial statements, consistent with institutional complementarities between reporting and banking systems.

								We investigate how firms’ disclosure decisions interact. We predict and find that mandating some firms’ disclosures reduces other firms’ voluntary disclosures.
								The reduction of firms’ voluntary disclosures in the presence of peer firms’ mandatory disclosures suggests informational spillovers from peers’ mandatory disclosures.
								Consistent with such spillovers, firms reduce their voluntary disclosures more the greater the number of local peers from which firms and their stakeholders can learn and hide.
								These results hold for a number of alternative disclosure measures and our identifying assumptions receive empirical support across several in- and out-of-sample validation tests.

								We propose the standard neoclassical model of investment under uncertainty with short-run adjustment frictions as a benchmark for earnings-return patterns
								absent accounting influences. We show that our proposed benchmark produces a number of earnings-return relations commonly attributed to accounting influences.
								In particular, we document that the relation between earnings and returns is naturally concave (as documented by Basu (1997)) given short-run adjustment frictions
								and long-run optimal investment behavior. We explain the model intuition, estimate its key parameters, test its empirical predictions, and discuss the implications
								of our proposed benchmark for the accounting conservatism literature. We suggest that our benchmark for earnings and return properties absent accounting influences
								is useful in identifying the incremental effect of accounting after considering first order economic influences in a wide number of contexts and can, therefore,
								contribute to the improvement of existing measures of and approaches to identifying accounting-related effects.

								We develop and test an economic framework specific to firms’ public disclosure decisions. Building upon supply and demand curves, our analytical
								analysis suggests that the number of firms’ transacting stakeholders is a major determinant of disclosure demand and, hence, firms’ public disclosure decision.
								Using comprehensive data on stakeholders’ revealed preferences for firms’ public disclosure, our empirical analysis supports the predicted importance of the number
								of transacting stakeholders for firms’ public disclosure across several settings and disclosure margins (e.g., extensive and intensive margin, disclosure quantity and quality).
								Our framework is particularly suited for guiding the growing literature investigating non-standard public disclosure settings such as private firms and the influence of
								stakeholders other than shareholders.
